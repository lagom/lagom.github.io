## Updating a Lagom project to version 1.4.5

To update an sbt project, change the version of `lagom-sbt-plugin` in your `project/plugins.sbt` file.

To update a Maven project, change the `lagom.version` property in your top-level `pom.xml`.

After updating, it is recommended to fix any new deprecation warnings you see when compiling or running your services.

## Updating to sbt 1.x

Support for sbt 1.x was quietly released with Lagom 1.4.0, but at the time we had not yet thoroughly tested it with Lagom, so we did not yet document this support or recommend it for most users.

Some adventurous users have been using it since then, and in the meantime we have updated all of our example applications and new project templates. Since we haven't encountered any new problems with sbt 1.x, we now recommend it for all users of Lagom with sbt.

You can update the sbt version in the `project/build.properties` file. The most recent version at the time of this writing is [1.1.5](https://developer.lightbend.com/blog/2018-05-09-sbt-1-1-5-patch-release/).

You might also need to update other plugins, global configuration, or custom build configuration. See the [sbt documentation](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Migrating-from-sbt-013x.html) for details on migrating from version 0.13.x.
