The Lagom team has released Lagom 1.4.10.

This release upgrades Play (and transitively upgrades Akka and Akka HTTP) and Scala.

## Highlights

- Updates Play to [2.6.21](https://blog.playframework.com/play-2-6-21-released//) with some minor improvements. This upgrade transitively upgrades Akka and Akka HTTP. Make sure you review Play's announcement for details.

If you are a user of [Lightbend Orchestration](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/lightbend-orchestration/current/setup/project-setup.html) you will have to upgrade your dependency of the `sbt-reactive-app` plugin to `1.6.1`.

See GitHub for the [full list of commits](https://github.com/lagom/lagom/compare/1.4.9...1.4.10) and the issues and pull requests assigned to the [1.4.10 milestone](https://github.com/lagom/lagom/milestone/41?closed=1).

## Updating a Lagom project to version 1.4.10

To update an sbt project, change the version of `lagom-sbt-plugin` in your `project/plugins.sbt` file.

To update a Maven project, change the `lagom.version` property in your top-level `pom.xml`.

After updating, it is recommended to fix any new deprecation warnings you see when compiling or running your services.
