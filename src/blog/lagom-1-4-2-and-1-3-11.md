- Fixes Exception deserialization for `BadRequest`. ([#1247](https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues/1247))
- Update to Scala 2.11.12. ([#1197](https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues/1197))
- Added a check to warn about slow startup problems (thanks [Edmondo Porcu](https://github.com/edmondo1984)).  ([#1112](https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues/1112))
- Improves error messages in path param serializer resolution (thanks [Neelaksh](https://github.com/silver-soule)). ([#1093](https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues/1093))

This release is the last including backports of general bugfixes and the `1.3.x` family may only get critical bugfixes backported onwards. If you are still using Lagom 1.3.x, we recommend you upgraded to latest versions of Lagom.

## Lagom 1.4.2

- Adds the message timestamp on the Kafka Message when using [metadata-rich subscriptions](https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.4.x/scala/MessageBrokerApi.html#Consuming-message-metadata).  ([#1277](https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues/1277))
- Fixes a bug preventing conflicts between persistence backends when writing tests with mixed persistence (applies only to java API). ( [#1263](https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues/1263))
- Added a timeout on the offset polling when starting a read-side to prevent a potential read-side block in certain failure scenarios. [#1278](https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues/1278)
