<h1 id="Lagom-1.4-Migration-Guide"><a class="section-marker" href="#Lagom-1.4-Migration-Guide">§</a>Lagom 1.4 Migration Guide</h1>
<p>This guide explains how to migrate from Lagom 1.3 to Lagom 1.4. If you are upgrading from an earlier version, be sure to review previous migration guides.</p><h2 id="Build-changes"><a class="section-marker" href="#Build-changes">§</a>Build changes</h2>
<p>The version of Lagom can be updated by editing the <code>project/plugins.sbt</code> file, and updating the version of the Lagom sbt plugin. For example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-scala">addSbtPlugin(&quot;com.lightbend.lagom&quot; % &quot;lagom-sbt-plugin&quot; % &quot;1.4.0-M1&quot;)
</code></pre><h2 id="Binding-services"><a class="section-marker" href="#Binding-services">§</a>Binding services</h2>
<p>Binding multiple Lagom service descriptors in one Lagom service has been deprecated. If you are currently binding multiple Lagom service descriptors in one Lagom service, you should combine these into one. The reason for this change is that we found most microservice deployment platforms simply don&rsquo;t support having multiple names for the one service, hence a service that serves multiple service descriptors, each with their own name, would not be compatible with those environments.</p>
<p>Consequently, we have deprecated the methods for binding multiple service descriptors. To migrate, in your application cake that binds your services, change the following code:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-scala">lazy val lagomServer = LagomServer.forServices(bindService[ItemService].to(wire[ItemServiceImpl]))
</code></pre>
<p>to:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-scala">lazy val lagomServer = serverFor[ItemService](wire[ItemServiceImpl])
</code></pre>
<p>The change to drop support for multiple services will require another code update on your <code>Application</code> class. Before you had to override <code>describeServices</code> like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-scala">  override def describeServices = List(
    readDescriptor[ItemService]
  )
</code></pre>
<p>That is now deprecated and will issue a warning on runtime (unfortunately scala 2.11 will not cause a compilation warning because of the deprecation). The method replacing <code>describeServices</code> is <code>describeService</code> (in singular) and it will take an <code>Option[Descriptor]</code> instead of a list:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-scala">  override def describeService = Some(readDescriptor[ItemService])
</code></pre><h2 id="Configuring-Cassandra-keyspaces"><a class="section-marker" href="#Configuring-Cassandra-keyspaces">§</a>Configuring Cassandra keyspaces</h2>
<p>Lagom 1.4 requires each service that uses Cassandra persistence to define three keyspace configuration settings in <code>application.conf</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-conf">cassandra-journal.keyspace = my_service_journal
cassandra-snapshot-store.keyspace = my_service_snapshot
lagom.persistence.read-side.cassandra.keyspace = my_service_read_side
</code></pre>
<p>While different services should be isolated by using different keyspaces, it is perfectly fine to use the same keyspace for all of these components within one service. In that case, it can be convenient to define a custom keyspace configuration property and use <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config#factor-out-common-values">property substitution</a> to avoid repeating it.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-conf">my-service.cassandra.keyspace = my_service

cassandra-journal.keyspace = ${my-service.cassandra.keyspace}
cassandra-snapshot-store.keyspace = ${my-service.cassandra.keyspace}
lagom.persistence.read-side.cassandra.keyspace = ${my-service.cassandra.keyspace}
</code></pre>
<p>If you are using macOS or Linux, or have other access to a bash scripting environment, running this shell script in your base project directory can help add this configuration to existing services:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/bash

set -eu

for svc_dir in *-impl; do
    svc=${svc_dir%-impl}

    # change $svc_dir to $svc on the next line to leave out the _impl suffix
    keyspace=$(tr - _ &lt;&lt;&lt;$svc_dir)
    cat &gt;&gt; $svc_dir/src/main/resources/application.conf &lt;&lt;END
$svc.cassandra.keyspace = $keyspace

cassandra-journal.keyspace = \${$svc.cassandra.keyspace}
cassandra-snapshot-store.keyspace = \${$svc.cassandra.keyspace}
lagom.persistence.read-side.cassandra.keyspace = \${$svc.cassandra.keyspace}
END
done
</code></pre>
<p>Previous versions of Lagom automatically calculated a default Cassandra keyspace for each service, based on the name of the service project, and injected this keyspace configuration in development mode. When running in production, these calculated keyspaces were not used, resulting in multiple services sharing the same keyspaces by default.</p>
<p>In Lagom 1.4, services that use Cassandra persistence will fail on startup when these properties are not defined.</p>

<p>The internal upgrade to latest major versions of Play and Akka may need some changes in your code if you are using either of them directly. Please refer to the <a href="https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.6.x/Migration26">Play 2.6 migration guide</a> and the <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/project/migration-guide-2.4.x-2.5.x.html">Akka 2.5 migration guide</a> for more details.</p><h3 id=" Rolling-upgrade"><a class="section-marker" href="# Rolling-upgrade">§</a> Rolling upgrade</h3>
<p>When running a rolling upgrade the nodes composing your Akka cluster must keep the ability to connect to each other and must use the same serialization formats. </p>
<p>One relevant change Akka 2.5 introduced involves a new method (DData) to <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/project/migration-guide-2.4.x-2.5.x.html#cluster-sharding-state-store-mode">internally handle the sharding</a> of your Persistent Entities in Lagom. We have decided to not enable that new method so your migration from Lagom 1.3.x to 1.4.x should be fine. You may opt in and use DData instead of the default persistence-based one. Switching from persistence-based to DData requires a complete-cluster shutdown.</p>
<p>The Java serialization was already discouraged and since Lagom 1.4.0 it is not the default anymore. This is a setting we inherit from Akka and which we are propagating transparently. If your code was dependant on the Java serialization you will need to review your serializers. This change in the defaults will also affect your ability to do a rolling upgrade. If you must support rolling upgrades and you depended on the default serializations you may override the new defaults using the <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/project/migration-guide-2.4.x-2.5.x.html#additional-serialization-bindings">additional-serialization-bindings</a> settings.</p>
