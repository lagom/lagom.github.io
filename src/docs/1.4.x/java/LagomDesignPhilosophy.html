<p>Consider some of the basic requirements of a Reactive Microservice as identified by Jonas Bonér (quotes extracted from <a href="https://info.lightbend.com/COLL-20XX-Reactive-Microservices-Architecture-RES-LP.html"><em>Reactive Microservices Architecture: Design Principles for Distributed Systems</em></a>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;<em>Isolation</em> is a prerequisite for resilience and elasticity and requires asynchronous communication between service boundaries &hellip;&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;An <em>autonomous service</em> can only <em>promise</em> its own behaviour by publishing its protocol/API.&rdquo; and &ldquo;For a service to become location transparent, it needs to be addressable.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;What is needed is that each Microservice take sole responsibility for their own state and the persistence thereof.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>The following Lagom characteristics promote these best practices:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Lagom is asynchronous by default &mdash; its APIs make inter-service communication via streaming a first-class concept. All Lagom APIs use the asynchronous IO capabilities of <a href="https://akka.io/">Akka Stream</a> for asynchronous streaming; the Java API uses <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletionStage.html">JDK8 <code>CompletionStage</code></a> for asynchronous computation; the Scala API uses <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/api/2.12.x/scala/concurrent/Future.html">Futures</a>.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Lagom favors distributed persistent patterns in contrast with traditional centralized databases. We encourage &mdash; but do not require &mdash; an event-sourced architecture for data persistence. The default pattern for persisting entities takes advantage of Event Sourcing (ES) with Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS). <a href="ES_CQRS.html">Managing data persistence</a> explains at a high level what event sourcing is and why it is valuable. <a href="PersistentEntity.html">Persistent Entity</a> introduces Lagom&rsquo;s implementation of event sourcing.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Lagom provides an implementation of a service registry and a service gateway for development purposes along with the internal plumbing for managing client and server-side service discovery. <a href="ServiceDiscovery.html">Registering and discovering services</a> introduces these concepts.</p></li>
</ul>
