<p>Lagom is a Swedish word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagom">meaning</a> &ldquo;just the right amount&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Often, when people talk about microservices, they focus on the micro part of the name, assuming it means that a service should be small. We want to emphasize that the important thing when splitting a system into services is to find the right boundaries between services. This means aligning them with bounded contexts, business capabilities, and isolation requirements. A system of right-sized microservices will naturally achieve scalability and resilience requirements and be easy to deploy and manage. So, rather than focus on how small your services should be, design &ldquo;Lagom&rdquo; size services.</p>
