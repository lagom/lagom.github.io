<p>As outlined in the <a href="DevEnvironment.html#One-task-to-run-them-all">development environment introduction</a>, all Lagom services defined in a build can be run with a single task: <code>runAll</code>. When executing this task, an embedded <a href="ServiceLocator.html">Service Locator</a> is started, an embedded <a href="CassandraServer.html">Cassandra server</a> is also started, and then all your services are started, in parallel. Furthermore, all started services will be running in hot-reload mode. Hot-reload means that the services are automatically reloaded on every change you make, so that you don&rsquo;t have to manually restart them.</p>
<p>Most times, the <code>runAll</code> task will serve you well. However, there will be occasions when you may want to manually start only a few services, and this is when the <code>run</code> task will come in handy. The <code>run</code> task is available to each of your Lagom service implementation projects, and you can execute it by simply prefixing the service project&rsquo;s name, i.e., <code>&lt;your-lagom-project-name&gt;/run</code>.</p>
<p>One thing you should remember is that <code>run</code> only starts the specific service, it doesn&rsquo;t start neither the Service Locator, nor the Cassandra server. Hence, prior to manually starting services, you may want to manually start both the <a href="ServiceLocator.html#Start-and-stop">Service Locator</a>, and the <a href="CassandraServer.html#Start-and-stop">Cassandra server</a>.</p>
