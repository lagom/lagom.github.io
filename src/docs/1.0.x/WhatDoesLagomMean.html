<p>Lagom is a Swedish word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagom">meaning</a> &ldquo;just the right amount&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Often, when people talk about microservices, they focus on the micro part, saying that a service should be small. We want to emphasize that the important thing when splitting a system into services is to find the right boundaries between services, aligning them with bounded contexts, business capabilities, and isolation requirements. As a result, a microservice-based system can achieve its scalability and resilience requirements, making it easy to deploy and manage.</p>
<p>So, the focus should not be on how small the services are, but rather on having services that are just the right size. They should be &ldquo;Lagom&rdquo; size services.</p>
