<p>A Service Locator is embedded in Lagom&rsquo;s development environment, allowing services to discover and communicate with each others. There are a number of settings and tasks available to tune the embedded Service Locator to your liking, let&rsquo;s explore them:</p><h2 id="Default-port"><a class="section-marker" href="#Default-port">§</a><a href="#default-port" name="default-port">Default port</a></h2>
<p>By default, the service locator is running on port <code>8000</code>, but it is possible to use a different port. For instance, by adding the following in your build, the Service Locator is run on port <code>10000</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-sbt">lagomServiceLocatorPort in ThisBuild := 10000</code></pre><h2 id="Communicating-with-external-services"><a class="section-marker" href="#Communicating-with-external-services">§</a><a href="#communicating-with-external-services" name="communicating-with-external-services">Communicating with external services</a></h2>
<p>It is possible to enable communication between the Lagom services defined in your build, and an unbounded number of external services (which could either be running locally or on a different machine). The first thing you will have to do is to register each external service in the Service Locator. Assume we want to register an external service named <code>weather</code> that is running on <code>http://localhost:3333</code>, here is what we would add to the build:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-sbt">lagomUnmanagedServices in ThisBuild := Map(&quot;weather&quot; -&gt; &quot;http://localhost:3333&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The above ensures that the Service Locator knows about the <code>weather</code> service. Then, if you need a Lagom service to communicate with it, simply <code>@Inject</code> the <a href="api/index.html?com/lightbend/lagom/javadsl/api/ServiceLocator.html"><code>ServiceLocator</code></a> and use it to either locate the <code>weather</code> service&rsquo;s URI, or perform some arbitrary work with it.</p><h3 id="Integrating-with-external-Lagom-projects"><a class="section-marker" href="#Integrating-with-external-Lagom-projects">§</a><a href="#integrating-with-external-lagom-projects" name="integrating-with-external-lagom-projects">Integrating with external Lagom projects</a></h3>
<p>Note that if the service you want to communicate with is actually a Lagom service, you may want to read the documentation for <a href="MultipleBuilds.html">integrating with an external Lagom projects</a>.</p><h2 id="Start-and-stop"><a class="section-marker" href="#Start-and-stop">§</a><a href="#start-and-stop" name="start-and-stop">Start and stop</a></h2>
<p>The Service Locator is automatically started when executing the <code>runAll</code> task. However, there are times when you might want to manually start only a few services, and hence you won&rsquo;t use the <code>runAll</code> task. In this case, you can manually start the Service Locator via the <code>lagomServiceLocatorStart</code> task, and stopping it with the <code>lagomServiceLocatorStop</code> task.</p><h2 id="Disable-it"><a class="section-marker" href="#Disable-it">§</a><a href="#disable-it" name="disable-it">Disable it</a></h2>
<p>You can disable the embedded Service Locator by adding the following in your build:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-sbt">lagomServiceLocatorEnabled in ThisBuild := false</code></pre>
<p>Be aware that by disabling the Service Locator your services will not be able to communicate. To restore communication, you will have to provide an implementation of <a href="api/index.html?com/lightbend/lagom/javadsl/api/ServiceLocator.html"><code>ServiceLocator</code></a>.</p>
