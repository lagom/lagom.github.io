<p>Lagom is a framework for creating microservice-based systems. It offers four main features:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="ServiceDescriptors.html">Service API</a></li>
  <li><a href="PersistentEntity.html">Persistence API</a></li>
  <li><a href="DevEnvironment.html">Development Environment</a></li>
  <li><a href="ConductR.html">Production Environment</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="ServiceDescriptors.html">Service API</a> provides a way to declare and implement service interfaces, to be consumed by clients. For location transparency, clients discover services through a Service Locator. The Service API supports synchronous request-response calls as well as asynchronous streaming between services.</p>
<p>The <a href="PersistentEntity.html">Persistence API</a> provides event-sourced persistent entities for services that store data. Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) read-side support is provided as well. Lagom manages the distribution of persisted entities across a cluster of nodes, enabling sharding and horizontal scaling. Cassandra is provided as a database out-of-the-box.</p>
<p>The <a href="DevEnvironment.html">Development Environment</a> allows running all your services, and the supporting Lagom infrastructure, with one command. It hot-reloads your services when code changes; no fragile scripts are needed to set up and maintain a development environment. With Lagom, a developer can bring up a new service or join an existing Lagom development team in just a few minutes.</p>
<p><a href="ConductR.html">Lightbend ConductR</a> is the out-of-the-box supported production environment. Lightbend ConductR allows simple deployment, monitoring, and scaling, of Lagom services in a container environment.</p>
