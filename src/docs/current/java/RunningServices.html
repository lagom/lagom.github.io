<h1 id="Running-services"><a class="section-marker" href="#Running-services">ยง</a>Running services</h1>
<p>As outlined in the <a href="DevEnvironment.html">development environment introduction</a>, all Lagom services defined in a build can be run with a single task: <code>runAll</code>. When executing this task, an embedded <a href="ServiceLocator.html">Service Locator</a> is started, an embedded <a href="CassandraServer.html">Cassandra server</a> is also started, and then all your services are started, in parallel. Furthermore, all started services will be running in hot-reload mode. Hot-reload means that the services are automatically reloaded on every change you make, so that you don&rsquo;t have to manually restart them.</p>
<p>Most times, the <code>runAll</code> task will serve you well. However, there will be occasions when you may want to manually start only a few services, and this is when the <code>run</code> task will come in handy. The <code>run</code> task is available to each of your Lagom service implementation projects.</p>
<p>In Maven, you can execute the <code>run</code> task on a particular service by using the maven project list flag, like so:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>$ mvn -pl &lt;your-project-name&gt; lagom:run
</code></pre>
<p>In sbt, you can specify the project to run on the sbt console by simply prefixing the service project&rsquo;s name, i.e.:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>$ sbt
&gt; &lt;your-project-name&gt;/run
</code></pre>
<p>One thing you should remember is that <code>run</code> only starts the specific service, it doesn&rsquo;t start neither the Service Locator, nor the Cassandra server. Hence, prior to manually starting services, you may want to manually start both the <a href="ServiceLocator.html#Start-and-stop">Service Locator</a>, and the <a href="CassandraServer.html#Start-and-stop">Cassandra server</a>.</p>
