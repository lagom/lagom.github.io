      <h3>Is Lagom open source or commercial?</h3>  Lagom is
      completely open source and has a vibrant and growing community. However,
      you do have the option to purchase a <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/platform/subscription">Lightbend subscription</a> that
      provides technical support as well as license to use Enterprise Suite,
      which includes a range of powerful Application Management, Intelligent
      Monitoring, Enterprise Integration and Advanced Tooling.     </p>
      <h3>Does Lagom require me to use
    Cassandra for persistence?</h2> 
    <p> No. However, Cassandra
    provides scalability and replication, which is why Lagom uses it by default
    for storing event journals. We recommend using projections to satisfy the
    read-side of your application.  For read-side, Lagom supports MySQL,
    PostreSQL, Oracle, and H2 through JDBC or JPA  see

        <h3>In the Java API, why are event interfaces present in
        both API and impl classes with only slight differences between them?
      </h3> <p>This is an example of an anti-corruption layer (ACL). In Lagom, we use
        anti-corruption layers for all API payloads (requests/responses) and
         published events. While it might seem like unnecessary duplication,
        using ACLs allows the implementation to be changed in <code>-impl</code> classes without
        changing the public API. For example, you
        might want to enrich an internal event with some fields that you need on
        a read side but you donâ€™t need on the published events.     </p>

        <h3>How can I design a service so that it can read back its own events without seeing events from other services?</h3>
        
        <p> One way to do this is to write events using <code>CassandraSession</code>. Each event can have an ID. Then, add a service call that queries Cassandra for
        events by ID. Remember to de-duplicate events because Kafka will provide at-least-once delivery. If you use a unique
        event ID as part of the primary key, it will be easy to identify duplicates.     </p>
