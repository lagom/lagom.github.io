<h3>Is Lagom open source or commercial?</h3>  

<p>Lagom is completely open source, free to use,  and has a vibrant and growing
community. However, you do have the option to purchase a <a
href="https://www.lightbend.com/platform/subscription">Lightbend
subscription</a> that provides technical support as well as license to use
Enterprise Suite, which includes a range of powerful application management,
intelligent monitoring, and enterprise integration tooling.     </p>

<h3>Does Lagom require me to use Cassandra for persistence?</h3>   

<p>No, Lagom supports using either Cassandra or relational databases, including
MySQL, PostegreSQL, Oracle and H2. The Lagom development environment provides
and uses Cassandra by default because it offers great scalability and
replication features.  See more in the <a
href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.3.x/java/PersistentEntity.html">Java
documentation</a> or the <a
href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.3.x/scala/PersistentEntity.html">Scala
documentation</a>. </p>      

<h3>Why are event interfaces present in both API and impl classes with only
slight differences between them? </h3> 
      
<p>This is an example of an anti-corruption layer. In Lagom, we use
anti-corruption layers for all API payloads (requests/responses) and published
events. While it might seem like unnecessary duplication, using anti-corruption
layers allows the implementation to be changed in <code>-impl</code> classes
without changing the public API. For example, you might want to enrich an
internal event with some fields that you need on a read side but you donâ€™t need
on the published events.</p>
