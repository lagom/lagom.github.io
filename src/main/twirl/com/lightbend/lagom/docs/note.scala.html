    <h2>Lagom is Approaching EOL</h2>
    <p>This project will only receive security patches until July 1, 2024, at that point the project will no longer
        receive any additional patches.</p>

    <p>If you are an existing customer of Lightbend and we have not yet contacted you, please reach out to Support.</p>

    <p>We recommend migrating any existing work to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.akka.io/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 700;">Akka</a> for deeply customized projects with complex infrastructure needs. Akka now contains the vast majority
            of Lagom features.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.kalix.io/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 700;">Kalix</a> for a managed scalable environment with an abstraction above the Akka framework layer to allow you to
            focus only on business logic. </li>
    </ul>
